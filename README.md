# Jupyter Notebook to Cloud Deployment: A Learning Journey

This project is a hands-on exploration of transforming a Jupyter notebook into a modular Python project and deploying it on a cloud environment. It focuses not on building the perfect machine learning model but on understanding the process of writing clean, reusable, and deployable code. The notebook I use is from an old project where I only wanted to extract information so almost no care was given into making it presentable and the code efficient.

This Readme file will be updated as I continue the project.

## üìö Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Learn how to refactor Jupyter notebooks into structured `.py` files.
- Explore best practices for organizing Python code into a deployable package.
- Gain experience deploying a project to a cloud environment.
- Showcase my ability to approach software engineering tasks methodically.

This project serves as a learning experience and portfolio piece.

## üöÄ Project Features

1. **Code Refactoring**: A Jupyter notebook has been refactored into reusable `.py` files, including utility functions and a logging setup.
2. **Cloud Deployment**: The project is structured for deployment on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
3. **Modular Design**: Focused on readability and maintainability with the use of a `setup.py` for packaging and dependency management.
4. **Logging**: Integrated a logger for tracking the execution and performance of the codebase.
5. **Requirements Management**: Dependencies are clearly outlined in `requirements.txt`.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`setup.py`**: Configures the project as a Python package, making it easy to install and use.
- **`logger.py`**: Contains a simple and reusable logging utility to track project execution.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all project dependencies for reproducibility and ease of setup.
- Additional Python modules will be added on later stages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
- **Cloud Platforms**: Not yet implemented
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## üåü Goals and Next Steps

1. **Learn Cloud Deployment**: Deploy this project to a cloud platform, gaining familiarity with cloud environments.
2. **Implement Testing**: Add unit and integration tests to ensure robustness.
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Apply feedback and learn from potential collaborators.

## üí° Inspiration

This project draws significant inspiration from tutorials by Krish Naik on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@krishnaik06). His content has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of structuring machine learning projects and deploying them effectively.
